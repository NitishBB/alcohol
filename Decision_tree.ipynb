This diagram explains the creation of a Machine Learning model from scratch and then taking the same model further with hyperparameter tuning to increase its accuracy, deciding the deployment strategies for that model and once deployed setting up the logging and monitoring frameworks to generate reports and dashboards based on the client requirements. \n",

    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree algorithm is one of the most versatile algorithms in machine learning which can perform both classification and regression analysis. It is very powerful and works great with complex datasets. Apart from that, it is very easy to understand and read. That makes it more popular to use. When coupled with ensemble techniques – which we will learn very soon- it performs even better.\n",
    "As the name suggests, this algorithm works by dividing the whole dataset into a tree-like structure based on some rules and conditions and then gives prediction based on those conditions.\n",
    "Let’s understand the approach to decision tree with a basic scenario. \n",
    "Suppose it’s Friday night and you are not able to decide if you should go out or stay at home. Let the decision tree decide it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Decision_tree1.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                         \n",
    "Although we may or may not use the decision tree for such decisions, this was a basic example to help you understand how a decision tree makes a decision.\n",
    "So how did it work?\n",
    "*\tIt selects a root node based on a given condition, e.g. our root node was chosen as time >10 pm.\n",
    "*\tThen, the root node was split into child notes based on the given condition. The right child node in the above figure fulfilled the condition, so no more questions were asked.\n",
    "*\tThe left child node didn’t fulfil the condition, so again it was split based on a new condition.\n",
    "*\tThis process continues till all the conditions are met or if you have predefined the depth of your tree, e.g. the depth of our tree is 3, and it reached there when all the conditions were exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how the parent nodes and condition is chosen for the splitting to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Tree for Regression\n",
    "When performing regression with a decision tree, we try to divide the given values of X into distinct and non-overlapping regions, e.g. for a set of possible values X1, X2,..., Xp; we will try to divide them into J distinct and non-overlapping regions R1, R2, . . . , RJ.\n",
    "For a given observation falling into the region Rj, the prediction is equal to the mean of the response(y) values for each training observations(x) in the region Rj. \n",
    "The regions R1,R2, . . . , RJ  are selected in a way to reduce the following sum of squares of residuals :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"formula1.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                                        \n",
    "Where, yrj (second term) is the mean of all the response variables in the region ‘j’.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive binary splitting(Greedy approach)\n",
    "As mentioned above, we try to divide the X values into j regions, but it is very expensive in terms of computational time to try to fit every set of X values into j regions. Thus, decision tree opts for a top-down greedy approach in which nodes are divided into two regions based on the given condition, i.e. not every node will be split but the ones which satisfy the condition are split into two branches. It is called greedy because it does the best split at a given step at that point of time rather than looking for splitting a step for a better tree in upcoming steps. It decides a threshold value(say s) to divide the observations into different regions(j) such that the RSS for Xj>= s and Xj <s is minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"formula2.PNG\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "                      \n",
    "Here for the above equation, j and s are found such that this equation has the minimum value.\n",
    "The regions R1, R2 are selected based on that value of s and j such that the equation above has the minimum value.\n",
    "Similarly, more regions are split out of the regions created above based on some condition with the same logic. This continues until a stopping criterion (predefined) is achieved.\n",
    "Once all the regions are split, the prediction is made based on the mean of observations in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process mentioned above has a high chance of overfitting the training data as it will be very complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree Pruning\n",
    "Tree pruning is the method of trimming down a full tree (obtained through the above process) to reduce the complexity and variance in the data. Just as we regularised linear regression, we can also regularise the decision tree model by adding a new term. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"formula3.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                       \n",
    "Where, T  is the subtree which is a subset of the full tree T0\n",
    "And α is the non-negative tuning parameter which penalises the MSE with an increase in tree length.\n",
    "By using cross-validation, such values of α and T are selected for which our model gives the lowest test error rate.\n",
    "This is how the decision tree regression model works. Let’s now see the working algorithm of doing classification using a decision tree.\n",
    "Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "As per Hands-on machine learning book “greedy algorithm greedily searches for an optimum split at the top level, then repeats the process at each level. It does not check whether or not the split will lead to the lowest possible impurity several levels down. A greedy algorithm often produces a reasonably good solution, but it is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-pruning, also known as backward pruning, is the process where the decision tree is generated first and then the non-significant branches are removed. Cross-validation set of data is used to check the effect of pruning and tests whether expanding a node will make an improvement or not. If any improvement is there then we continue by expanding that node else if there is reduction in accuracy then the node not be expanded and should be converted in a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-pruning, also known as forward pruning, stops the non-significant branches from generating. It uses a condition to decide when should it terminate splitting of some of the branches prematurely as the tree is generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees are used for quantitative data. In the case of qualitative data or categorical data, we use classification trees.  In regression trees, we split the nodes based on RSS criteria, but in classification, it is done using classification error rate, Gini impurity and entropy.\n",
    "Let’s understand these terms in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entropy\n",
    "Entropy is the measure of randomness in the data. In other words, it gives the impurity present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"entropy.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                           \n",
    "When we split our nodes into two regions and put different observations in both the regions, the main goal is to reduce the entropy i.e. reduce the randomness in the region and divide our data cleanly than it was in the previous node. If splitting the node doesn’t lead into entropy reduction, we try to split based on a different condition, or we stop. \n",
    "A region is clean (low entropy) when it contains data with the same labels and random if there is a mixture of labels present (high entropy).\n",
    "Let’s suppose there are ‘m’ observations and we need to classify them into categories 1 and 2.\n",
    "Let’s say that category 1 has ‘n’ observations and category 2 has ‘m-n’ observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "p= n/m  and    q = m-n/m = 1-p\n",
    "\n",
    "then, entropy for the given set is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          E = -p*log2(p) – q*log2(q) \n",
    "           \n",
    "           \n",
    "When all the observations belong to category 1, then p = 1 and all observations belong to category 2, then p =0, int both cases E =0, as there is no randomness in the categories.\n",
    "If half of the observations are in category 1 and another half in category 2, then p =1/2 and q =1/2, and the entropy is maximum, E =1.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Information Gain\n",
    "Information gain calculates the decrease in entropy after splitting a node. It is the difference between entropies before and after the split. The more the information gain, the more entropy is removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"info_gain.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",

    "#### Ginni Impurity\n",
    "According to wikipedia, ‘Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labelled if it was randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.’\n",
    "It is calculated by multiplying the probability that a given observation is classified into the correct class and sum of all the probabilities when that particular observation is classified into the wrong class.\n",

    "Suppose you train a model on a given dataset using any specific algorithm. You tried to find the accuracy of the trained model using the same training data and found the accuracy to be 95% or maybe even 100%. What does this mean? Is your model ready for prediction? The answer is no.\n",
    "Why? Because your model has trained itself on the given data, i.e. it knows the data and it has generalized over it very well. But when you try and predict over a new set of data, it’s most likely to give you very bad accuracy, because it has never seen the data before and thus it fails to generalizes well over it. This is the problem of overfitting. \n",
    "To tackle such problem, Cross-validation comes into the picture. Cross-validation is a resampling technique with a basic idea of dividing the training dataset into two parts i.e. train and test. On one part(train) you try to train the model and on the second part(test) i.e. the data which is unseen for the model, you make the prediction and check how well your model works on it. If the model works with good accuracy on your test data, it means that the model has not overfitted the training data and can be trusted with the prediction, whereas if it performs with bad accuracy then our model is not to be trusted and we need to tweak our algorithm.\n",

    "There is a very good explanation given in the ISLR Book as given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A k-fold CV with k < n has a computational advantage to LOOCV. But putting computational issues aside,\n",
    "a less obvious but potentially more important advantage of k-fold CV is that it often gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than does LOOCV.\n",
    "The validation set approach can lead to overestimates of the test error rate since in this approach the\n",
    "the training set used to fit the statistical learning method contains only half the observations of the entire data set. Using this logic, it is not hard to see that LOOCV will give approximately unbiased estimates of the test error since each training set contains n − 1 observations, which is almost as many as the number of observations in the full data set. And performing k-fold CV for, say, k = 5 or k = 10 will lead to an intermediate level of bias since each training set contains (k − 1)n/k observations—fewer than\n",
    "in the LOOCV approach, but substantially more than in the validation set approach. Therefore, from the perspective of bias reduction, it is clear that LOOCV is to be preferred to k-fold CV. However, we know that bias is not the only source for concern in an estimating procedure; we must also consider the procedure’s variance. It turns out that LOOCV has higher variance than does k-fold CV with k < n. Why\n",
    "is this the case? When we perform LOOCV, we are in effect averaging the outputs of n fitted models, each of which is trained on an almost identical set of observations; therefore, these outputs are highly (positively) correlated with each other. In contrast, when we perform k-fold CV with k < n, we are averaging the outputs of k fitted models that are somewhat less correlated with each other since the overlap between the training sets in each model is smaller. Since the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than does the test error estimate resulting from k-fold CV.\n",
